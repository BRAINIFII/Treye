# Treye
Treye is an Amazon Price Tracker which lets you buy products on
Amazon wisely. Treye can monitor millions of products.
Moreover, the real-time tracker alerts you timely, when the product
prices drop. On the other hand, this helps you decide when to buy the
product and when to skip shopping.
Treye-watchdog lets you create Amazon product price watches and get
alerts via email and Notification Toasts when prices drop.
